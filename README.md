# 01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refactor

This repository contains the first homework: 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor. The instructions and criteria for this assignment are below. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


Below are the changes I made to accomodate the acceptence criteria listed: 

index.html
realigned code to ensure everything was nested appropriately
added section notes to differentiate between elements
changed <h2> in footer to <h4> so that the header elements were in sequential order
line 34: added id="search-engine-optimization" so that it would link to the appropriate section


style.css
consolidated header, content, and benefits css that was repeated
added section notes.
